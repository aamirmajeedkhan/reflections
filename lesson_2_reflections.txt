What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
When we intialize a repository we intimidate version control that this is the place
which we use for file tracking and from now we will start commiting stuff here.
This is the ground where we put / commit our work.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
Working directory is the place where you are git metafile resides it can have several different files which has nothing to do with version control where as staging area is a git concept 
where added files are places before being committed to git. 
staging area offers you a place to bundle your commit and a last opportunity to confirm 
what you are going to commit.
